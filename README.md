# Pinebot

A simple discord bot to whitelist players via discord.

Apart of a movement to transfer mc.nikesexparty.net to mc.pineserver.net, and provide a fully accesible archive of major servers hosted.

> Vanilla 2021+,
> Vanilla 2019,
> Vanilla 2018,
> Others

This is to be achieved using [itzg's docker minecraft server](https://github.com/itzg/docker-minecraft-server) and the autopause option whenever possible, as versions 1.18+ dislike the option in my experimenting.

## Launch Event

- A small gameplay event on Vanilla 2021+ which begins with PineBot "assimilating" the server away from 1917 roleplay. Players fight a more difficult ender dragon with additional phases/dangers, including a phase which spawns agroed enderman with special drops.
- Server Icon is changed to a purplish corrupted version of the future Pineserver Icon
- After an amount of time, PineBot drops an invite link in the discord channel, ending the event.
